1.Your task is to make two functions (max and min or maximum and minimunm depeding 
on the language ) that recive a list of integers as input and return the largest and lowest number in that list, respectively.
input:[45,333,76,29,900,23,474,654,29,454];
op :min;->23
max:->900
package test;

import java.util.Scanner;

public class maxmin {

	/*input:[45,333,76,29,900,23,474,654,29,454];
	op :min;->23
	max:->900
*/
	
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		
		
		
		    int count, max, min, i;
	        int[] inputArray = new int[10];
	   
	        Scanner in = new Scanner(System.in);
	   
	        System.out.println("Enter number of elements");
	        count = in.nextInt();
	        System.out.println("Enter " + count + " elements");
	         
	        for(i = 0; i < count; i++) {
	            inputArray[i] = in.nextInt();
	        }
	        
	        max = min = inputArray[0];
	        
	        for(i = 1; i < count; i++) {
	            if(inputArray[i] > max)
	                max = inputArray[i];
	            else if (inputArray[i] < min)
	                min = inputArray[i];
	                
	        }
	        System.out.println("min :-> " + min);
	        System.out.println("Max :-> " + max);
	        
	}
	
}


2.Timmy & Sarah think they are in love,but around where they live will only know once they pick a flower each.if one of the flowers has an even number of petals and the other has an odd numbers of petals it means they are in love.

write a function that will take the number of petals of each flower and return true if they are in love and false if they aren't.

3.wt are the genralized and specialized classes in java.

Generilization:The conversion of a  subclass type type into superclass is called specialization in java


Specilazation:The conversion of a superclass type into subclass type is called specialization in java

4.a) i don't want my classes to be inherited by another classes in java, what should i do?
b)can you  give a few examples of final classes defined in java API
c)

6.wt is the diff b/w Arraylist and LinkedList  and in java?
ArrayList use a dynamic array to store its elements.
ArrayList implements only List.
ArrayList is faster in storing and accessing data.

LinkedList uses Doubly Linked List to store its elements.
LinkedList is faster being node based as not much bit shifting required.
LinkedList implements List as well as Queue.
LinkedList is faster in manipulation of data.


7.wt is the diff b/w  ListIterator and Iterator in java?

ListIterator 
we can traverse the elements of a list in a forward direction and back ward direction.
ListIterator can be used in List collection only.
Important methods of ListIterator interface are add(), hasNext(), hasPrevious() and remove().

Iterator 
we can traverse the elements of a list in a forward directio. 
Iterator can be used in these collection types like List, Set, and Queue.
The important methods of Iterator interface are hasNext(), next() and remove() 



8.what is the covariant method overrloading java?
Covariant Method overriding means that when overriding a method in the child class, the return type may vary.

10.Explain static polymorphism and dynamic polymorphism?
static Polymorphism: It binds the method with method defination before the
excution of the main method.
Dynamic polymorphism: It binds the method with method defination during the
excution of the main method.

11)Hema Created a class called personInformation and she want to give securtiy for
the properties how can she achieve?
Ans:make All properties as Private and class as Final.
